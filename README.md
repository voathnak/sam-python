```

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)

## Setup process

### Local development

**Invoking function locally using a local sample payload**

```bash
sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event event.json
```

**Invoking function locally through local API Gateway**

```bash
sam local start-api
```

If the previous command ran successfully you should now be able to hit the following local endpoint to invoke your function `http://localhost:3000/hello`

**SAM CLI** is used to emulate both Lambda and API Gateway locally and uses our `template.yaml` to understand how to bootstrap this environment (runtime, where the source code is, etc.) - The following excerpt is what the CLI will read in order to initialize an API and its routes:

```yaml
...
Events:
    HelloWorld:
        Type: Api # More info about API Event Source: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#api
        Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get
```

## Packaging and deployment

AWS Lambda Python runtime requires a flat folder with all dependencies including the application. SAM will use `CodeUri` property to know where to look up for both application and dependencies:

```yaml
...
    HelloWorldFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
            CodeUri: hello_world/
            ...
```

Firstly, we need a `S3 bucket` where we can upload our Lambda functions packaged as ZIP before we deploy anything - If you don't have a S3 bucket to store code artifacts then this is a good time to create one:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, run the following command to package our Lambda function to S3:

```bash
sam package \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, the following command will create a Cloudformation Stack and deploy your SAM resources.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name sam-app \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

> **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-quick-start.html) for more details in how to get started.**

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name sam-app \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs[?OutputKey==`HelloWorldApi`]' \
    --output table
``` 

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called sam logs. sam logs lets you fetch logs generated by your Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name sam-app --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Testing


Next, we install test dependencies and we run `pytest` against our `tests` folder to run our initial unit tests:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-mock --user
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Cleanup

In order to delete our Serverless Application recently deployed you can use the following AWS CLI Command:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name sam-app
```

## Bringing to the next level

Here are a few things you can try to get more acquainted with building serverless applications using SAM:

### Learn how SAM Build can help you with dependencies

* Uncomment lines on `app.py`
* Build the project with ``sam build --use-container``
* Invoke with ``sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event event.json``
* Update tests

### Create an additional API resource

* Create a catch all resource (e.g. /hello/{proxy+}) and return the name requested through this new path
* Update tests

### Step-through debugging

* **[Enable step-through debugging docs for supported runtimes]((https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-using-debugging.html))**

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready to use Apps that go beyond hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications: [AWS Serverless Application Repository main page](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)

# Appendix

## Building the project

[AWS Lambda requires a flat folder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html) with the application as well as its dependencies in  deployment package. When you make changes to your source code or dependency manifest,
run the following command to build your project local testing and deployment:

```bash
sam build
```

If your dependencies contain native modules that need to be compiled specifically for the operating system running on AWS Lambda, use this command to build inside a Lambda-like Docker container instead:
```bash
sam build --use-container
```

By default, this command writes built artifacts to `.aws-sam/build` folder.

## SAM and AWS CLI commands

All commands used throughout this document

```bash
# Generate event.json via generate-event command
sam local generate-event apigateway aws-proxy > event.json

# Invoke function locally with event.json as an input
sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event event.json

# Run API Gateway locally
sam local start-api

# Create S3 bucket
aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME

# Package Lambda function defined locally and upload to S3 as an artifact
sam package \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME

# Deploy SAM template as a CloudFormation stack
sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name sam-app \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

# Describe Output section of CloudFormation stack previously created
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name sam-app \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs[?OutputKey==`HelloWorldApi`]' \
    --output table

# Tail Lambda function Logs using Logical name defined in SAM Template
sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name sam-app --tail
```

# Serverless REST API

This example demonstrates how to setup a [RESTful Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_web_services) allowing you to create, list, get, update and delete Todos. DynamoDB is used to store the data. This is just an example and of course you could use any data storage as a backend.

## Structure

This service has a separate directory for all the todo operations. For each operation exactly one file exists e.g. `todos/delete.py`. In each of these files there is exactly one function defined.

The idea behind the `todos` directory is that in case you want to create a service containing multiple resources e.g. users, notes, comments you could do so in the same service. While this is certainly possible you might consider creating a separate service for each resource. It depends on the use-case and your preference.

## Use-cases

- API for a Web Application
- API for a Mobile Application

## Setup

```bash
npm install -g serverless
```

## Deploy

In order to deploy the endpoint simply run

```bash
serverless deploy
```

The expected result should be similar to:

```bash
Serverless: Packaging service…
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3…
Serverless: Uploading service .zip file to S3…
Serverless: Updating Stack…
Serverless: Checking Stack update progress…
Serverless: Stack update finished…

## Usage

You can create, retrieve, update, or delete todos with the following commands:

### Create a Todo

```bash
curl -X POST https://$endpoint_key.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/todos --data '{ "text": "Learn Serverless" }'
```

No output

### List all Todos

```bash
curl https://$endpoint_key.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/todos
```

Example output:
```bash
[{"text":"Deploy my first service","id":"ac90feaa11e6-9ede-afdfa051af86","checked":true,"updatedAt":1479139961304},{"text":"Learn Serverless","id":"206793aa11e6-9ede-afdfa051af86","createdAt":1479139943241,"checked":false,"updatedAt":1479139943241}]%
```

### Get one Todo

```bash
# Replace the <id> part with a real id from your todos table
curl https://$endpoint_key.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/todos/<id>
```

Example Result:
```bash
{"text":"Learn Serverless","id":"ee6490d0-aa11e6-9ede-afdfa051af86","createdAt":1479138570824,"checked":false,"updatedAt":1479138570824}%
```

### Update a Todo

```bash
# Replace the <id> part with a real id from your todos table
curl -X PUT https://$endpoint_key.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/todos/<id> --data '{ "text": "Learn Serverless", "checked": true }'
```

Example Result:
```bash
{"text":"Learn Serverless","id":"ee6490d0-aa11e6-9ede-afdfa051af86","createdAt":1479138570824,"checked":true,"updatedAt":1479138570824}%
```

### Delete a Todo

```bash
# Replace the <id> part with a real id from your todos table
curl -X DELETE https://$endpoint_key.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/todos/<id>
```

No output

## Scaling

### AWS Lambda

By default, AWS Lambda limits the total concurrent executions across all functions within a given region to 100. The default limit is a safety limit that protects you from costs due to potential runaway or recursive functions during initial development and testing. To increase this limit above the default, follow the steps in [To request a limit increase for concurrent executions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html#increase-concurrent-executions-limit).

### DynamoDB

When you create a table, you specify how much provisioned throughput capacity you want to reserve for reads and writes. DynamoDB will reserve the necessary resources to meet your throughput needs while ensuring consistent, low-latency performance. You can change the provisioned throughput and increasing or decreasing capacity as needed.

This is can be done via settings in the `serverless.yml`.

```yaml
  ProvisionedThroughput:
    ReadCapacityUnits: 1
    WriteCapacityUnits: 1
```

In case you expect a lot of traffic fluctuation we recommend to checkout this guide on how to auto scale DynamoDB [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/auto-scale-dynamodb-with-dynamic-dynamodb/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/auto-scale-dynamodb-with-dynamic-dynamodb/)
